## Setup

* Collect the datasets (as .dat files) on which you want to compare the performance of SMOTE vs. Proposed Genetic Algorithm.
* Add the path (where datasets are stored) in the code where os.chdir("") is called.
* Run the code and get the results will be entered into <i>results.txt</i> file.

## Code Requirements

* Python version 2.7
* Python libraries
  * random
  * sklearn
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * imblearn
